1. Choose Your Blockchain Architecture
Consensus: Decide between Proof of Stake (PoS), Proof of Authority (PoA), or another consensus suitable for your use case.

Network Type: Public, private, or consortium.

Programming Language: Rust (Substrate), Go, or Python are popular for building blockchains from scratch.

2. Set Up Your Development Environment
Install the necessary SDKs and frameworks (e.g., Substrate for Rust, Cosmos SDK for Go, or even a minimal Python/Go chain for learning).

Set up your nodes (cloud, on-premises, or hybrid).

3. Design Blockchain Data Structures
Block Structure: Include fields for timestamp, previous hash, transactions, and block hash.

Transaction Structure: Define custom transaction types for TLD minting, subdomain creation, metadata updates, and ownership transfers.

4. Implement Core Blockchain Logic
Genesis Block: Initialize your chain with a genesis block.

Block Validation: Implement logic for validating and adding new blocks.

Consensus Mechanism: Integrate your chosen consensus protocol.

5. Build TLD & Subdomain Registry Module
This module should support:

Minting TLDs as NFTs: Each TLD is unique and owned by a user.

Subdomain Registration: Subdomains are registered under TLDs, with on-chain ownership.

Metadata Storage: Store IPFS hashes or other metadata on-chain.

Royalties/Fees: TLD owners receive fees for subdomain registrations.

Uniqueness Enforcement: No duplicate TLDs or subdomains.

Ownership Transfer: Allow TLD NFT transfers.

Event Logging: Emit events for TLD and subdomain actions.

Sample Pseudocode for Custom Blockchain Module
python
# Pseudocode for TLD & Subdomain Registry on a Custom Blockchain

class TLDRegistry:
    def __init__(self):
        self.tlds = {}  # tld_name: owner_address
        self.subdomains = {}  # (tld_name, subdomain): (owner_address, metadata)
        self.tld_metadata = {}  # tld_name: metadata (e.g., IPFS)
        self.subdomain_fee = 0.01  # Example fee in native token

    def mint_tld(self, tld_name, owner, metadata):
        assert tld_name not in self.tlds, "TLD already exists"
        self.tlds[tld_name] = owner
        self.tld_metadata[tld_name] = metadata
        emit_event("TLDRegistered", owner, tld_name, metadata)

    def register_subdomain(self, tld_name, subdomain, registrant, metadata, fee_paid):
        assert self.tlds.get(tld_name), "TLD does not exist"
        assert (tld_name, subdomain) not in self.subdomains, "Subdomain exists"
        assert fee_paid >= self.subdomain_fee, "Insufficient fee"
        tld_owner = self.tlds[tld_name]
        transfer_fee(tld_owner, fee_paid)
        self.subdomains[(tld_name, subdomain)] = (registrant, metadata)
        emit_event("SubdomainRegistered", registrant, subdomain, tld_name, metadata)

    def transfer_tld(self, tld_name, new_owner):
        assert self.tlds.get(tld_name), "TLD does not exist"
        self.tlds[tld_name] = new_owner
        emit_event("TLDTransferred", tld_name, new_owner)

    def update_metadata(self, tld_name, subdomain, owner, new_metadata):
        assert self.subdomains.get((tld_name, subdomain)), "Subdomain does not exist"
        assert self.subdomains[(tld_name, subdomain)][0] == owner, "Not owner"
        self.subdomains[(tld_name, subdomain)] = (owner, new_metadata)
        emit_event("SubdomainMetadataUpdated", tld_name, subdomain, new_metadata)
6. Set Up the Network and Nodes
Deploy multiple nodes for decentralization.

Configure networking, security, and consensus parameters.

7. Test and Launch
Use a testnet to simulate TLD and subdomain minting, ownership transfers, and metadata updates.

Monitor for performance, consensus, and security issues.

8. Build Web3 Integration
Develop a Web3-compatible API or SDK for wallets and browsers to resolve and interact with your blockchain domains.

Optionally, build a browser extension or gateway for domain resolution.

Summary Table
Step	Action/Consideration
Consensus/Network	Choose PoS/PoA, public/private, and programming language
Core Blockchain	Implement block, transaction, consensus, and networking logic
TLD Module	Mint TLDs as NFTs, subdomain registration, metadata, royalties, uniqueness, events
Nodes	Deploy and configure nodes for decentralization
Web3 Integration	Expose APIs for wallets/browsers, build DApp frontend
Test & Launch	Use testnet, monitor, then launch mainnet
